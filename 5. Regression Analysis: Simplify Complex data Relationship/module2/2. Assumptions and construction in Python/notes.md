## Make Linear Regression assumptions

- <b>Model assumptions</b>: Statements about the data that must be true in order to justify the use of a particular modeling technique

### Linear Regression assumptions:

- <b>Linearity assumption</b>: Each predictor variable (Xi) is linearly related to the outcome variable (Y)
- <b>Normality assumption</b>: The residuals or errors are normally distributed
- <b>Independent observation assumption</b>: Each observation in the dataset is independent
- <b>Homoscedasticity assumption</b>: The variation of the residuals (errors) is constant or similar across the model
