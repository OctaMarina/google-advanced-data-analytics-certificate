# Foundation of linear regression

* Predicted values: The estimated Y values for each X calculated by a model
* Residual values: The difference between observed or actual values and the predicted values of the regression line
Residual = Observed - Predicted

The sum of the residuals is always equal to O.


### Sum of Squared Residuals
The sum of the squared differences between each observed value and its associated predicted value

Sum(from i=1 to n)(Observed-Predicted)^2

### Ordinary Least Squares
A method that minimizes the sum of squared residuals to estimate
parameters in a linear regression model
