<b>Regression</b> stands for analysing the relationship between a single dependent variable and one or multiple independent 
variables
# Linear Regression

* <b> Dependent variable</b>: The variable a given model estimates, also referred to as a response or outcome variable

* <b> Independent variable</b>: A variable that explains trends in the dependent variable, also referred to as an explanatory or predictor variable

Y = slope * X + intercept

* <b>Causation</b>: A cause-and-effect relationship where one variable directly causes the other to change in a particular way

<b>Causation is not correlation</b>!!!!
