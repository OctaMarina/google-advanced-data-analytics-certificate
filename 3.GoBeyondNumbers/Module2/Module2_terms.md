## Terms and Definitions from Previous Modules

### B
- **Bias**: In data structuring, bias refers to organizing data results into groupings, categories, or variables that misrepresent the overall dataset.

### C
- **Cleaning**: The process of removing errors that may distort the data or make it less useful; one of the six practices of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

### D
- **Data visualization**: A graphical representation of information such as a graph, chart, diagram, or dashboard.

- **Discovering**: The process by which data professionals familiarize themselves with a dataset, initiating the conceptualization of its potential uses; one of the six practices of EDA.

### E
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**: The process of investigating, organizing, and analyzing datasets, summarizing their main characteristics often through data wrangling and visualization methods. The six principal practices of EDA are: discovering, structuring, cleaning, joining, validating, and presenting.

### J
- **Joining**: The process of augmenting data by adding values from other datasets; one of the six practices of EDA.

### P
- **PACE**: A workflow model used by data professionals to maintain focus on the end goal of a dataset; acronym for Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute.

- **Presenting**: The process of making a cleaned dataset accessible to others for analysis or further modeling; one of the six practices of EDA.

### S
- **Structuring**: The act of organizing or transforming raw data to facilitate visualization, explanation, or modeling; one of the six practices of EDA.

### V
- **Validating**: The process of verifying that the data is consistent and of high quality; one of the six practices of EDA.
