# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Six Key Practices

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) prepares raw data for deeper analysis by applying a structured and methodical approach.  
The six essential practices in EDA are:

---

## 1. Discovering

**Purpose**:  
Identify what data is available, its general characteristics, and initial points of interest.

**Key Actions**:
- Review data sources and data types
- Understand initial shapes, distributions, and possible gaps
- Perform high-level summaries and basic visualizations

---

## 2. Structuring

**Purpose**:  
Organize data into a logical format that facilitates further analysis.

**Key Actions**:
- Define clear data models
- Reshape data if necessary (e.g., wide to long format)
- Establish keys and indexes

---

## 3. Cleaning

**Purpose**:  
Address errors, inconsistencies, and missing values to ensure data quality.

**Key Actions**:
- Handle missing or null values
- Correct data entry errors
- Standardize categories and formats
- Remove duplicates

---

## 4. Joining

**Purpose**:  
Combine multiple datasets in a coherent and meaningful way.

**Key Actions**:
- Merge tables based on common keys
- Perform joins (inner, left, right, full)
- Ensure consistency across merged datasets

---

## 5. Validating

**Purpose**:  
Check the integrity and reliability of the data after transformations.

**Key Actions**:
- Confirm that joins and cleaning steps preserved essential information
- Validate data against known benchmarks or expectations
- Identify remaining anomalies

---

## 6. Presenting

**Purpose**:  
Summarize and communicate the key findings from the data.

**Key Actions**:
- Create clear and insightful visualizations
- Develop dashboards or summary reports
- Highlight patterns, issues, and next steps for analysis
