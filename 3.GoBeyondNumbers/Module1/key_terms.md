# Key Terms in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Analytics

Below is a structured summary of important concepts and practices used in data analytics, particularly within the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process and the P.A.C.E. framework.

---

## Bias

**Definition**:  
In data structuring, bias refers to organizing data results in groupings, categories, or variables that misrepresent the whole dataset.

---

## Cleaning

**Definition**:  
The process of removing errors that might distort the data or make it less useful.  
**Context**:  
One of the six core practices of EDA.

---

## Data Visualization

**Definition**:  
A graph, chart, diagram, or dashboard created to represent information visually, making data easier to interpret and communicate.

---

## Discovering

**Definition**:  
The process data professionals use to familiarize themselves with a dataset in order to conceptualize how to use it.  
**Context**:  
One of the six core practices of EDA.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Definition**:  
The process of investigating, organizing, and analyzing datasets and summarizing their main characteristics.  
Often involves methods such as data wrangling and visualization.

**Six Main Practices of EDA**:
- Discovering
- Structuring
- Cleaning
- Joining
- Validating
- Presenting

---

## Joining

**Definition**:  
The process of augmenting data by adding values from other datasets.  
**Context**:  
One of the six core practices of EDA.

---

## P.A.C.E.

**Definition**:  
A workflow that data professionals can use to remain focused on the end goal of a data project.  
**Acronym**:
- Plan
- Analyze
- Construct
- Execute

---

## Presenting

**Definition**:  
The process of making a cleaned dataset available to others for analysis or further modeling.  
**Context**:  
One of the six core practices of EDA.

---

## Structuring

**Definition**:  
The process of taking raw data and organizing or transforming it to be more easily visualized, explained, or modeled.  
**Context**:  
One of the six core practices of EDA.

---

## Validating

**Definition**:  
The process of verifying that the data is consistent and of high quality.  
**Context**:  
One of the six core practices of EDA.
