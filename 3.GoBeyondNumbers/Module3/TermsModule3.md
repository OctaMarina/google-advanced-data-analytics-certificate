# Terms and Definitions

## Course 3, Module 3

- **Categorical data**: Data that is divided into a limited number of qualitative groups.
- **Collective outliers**: A group of abnormal points, following similar patterns and isolated from the rest of the population.
- **Contextual outliers**: Normal data points under certain conditions but become anomalies under most other conditions.
- **Data ethics**: Well-founded standards of right and wrong that dictate how data is collected, shared, and used.
- **Data governance**: A process for ensuring the formal management of a company’s data assets.
- **Deduplication**: The elimination or removal of matching data values in a dataset.
- **Docstring**: (Refer to documentation string).
- **Documentation string**: A group of text that explains what a method or function does; also referred to as a “docstring”.
- **Dummy variables**: Variables with values of 0 or 1 that indicate the presence or absence of something.
- **Global outliers**: Values that are completely different from the overall data group and have no association with any other outliers.
- **Heatmap**: A type of data visualization that depicts the magnitude of an instance or set of values based on two colors.
- **Input validation**: The practice of thoroughly analyzing and double-checking to make sure data is complete, error-free, and high quality.
- **Joining**: The process of augmenting data by adding values from other datasets; one of the six practices of EDA.
- **Label encoding**: Data transformation technique where each category is assigned a unique number instead of a qualitative value.
- **Missing data**: A data value that is not stored for a variable in the observation of interest.
- **Non-null count**: The total number of data entries for a data column that are not blank.
- **One-hot encoding**: A data transformation technique that turns one categorical variable into several binary variables.
- **Outliers**: Observations that are an abnormal distance from other values or an overall pattern in a data population.

## Terms from Previous Modules

### B
- **Bias**: In data structuring, bias refers to organizing data results in groupings, categories, or variables that are misrepresentative of the whole dataset.
- **Box plot**: A data visualization that depicts the locality, spread, and skew of groups of values within quartiles.

### C
- **Cleaning**: The process of removing errors that may distort your data or make it less useful; one of the six practices of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- **CSV file**: A simple text file that can be easy to import or store in other softwares, platforms, and databases.

### D
- **Database (DB) file**: A file type used to store data, often in tables, indexes, or fields.
- **Data source**: The location where data originates.
- **Data visualization**: A graph, chart, diagram, or dashboard that is created as a representation of information.
- **Discovering**: The process data professionals use to familiarize themselves with the data so they can start conceptualizing how to use it; one of the six practices of EDA.

### E
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The process of investigating, organizing, and analyzing datasets and summarizing their main characteristics, often by employing data wrangling and visualization methods. The six main practices of EDA are: discovering, structuring, cleaning, joining, validating, and presenting.
- **Extracting**: The process of retrieving data out of data sources for further data processing or storage.

### F
- **Filtering**: The process of selecting a smaller part of a dataset based on specified values and using it for viewing or analysis.
- **First-party data**: Data that was gathered from inside your own organization.

### G
- **Grouping**: The process of aggregating individual observations of a variable into groups.

### H
- **Hypothesis**: A theory or an explanation, based on evidence, that is not yet proven true.

### I
- **Info()**: Gives the total number of entries, along with the data types—called Dtypes in pandas—of the individual entries.
- **Int64**: A standard integer data type, representing numbers somewhere between negative nine quintillion and positive nine quintillion.

### J
- **Joining**: The process of augmenting data by adding values from other datasets; one of the six practices of EDA.
- **JSON file**: A data storage file that is saved in a JavaScript format.

### M
- **Merging**: A method to combine two (or more) different data frames along a specified starting column(s).

### P
- **PACE**: A workflow data professionals can use to remain focused on the end goal of any given dataset; stands for plan, analyze, construct, and execute.
- **Presenting**: The process of making a cleaned dataset available to others for analysis or further modeling; one of the six practices of EDA.

### S
- **Second-party data**: Data that was gathered outside your organization but directly from the original source.
- **Slicing**: A method for breaking information down into smaller parts to facilitate efficient examination and analysis from different viewpoints.
- **Sorting**: The process of arranging data into a meaningful order for analysis.
- **String**: A sequence of characters and punctuation that contains textual information.
- **Structuring**: The process of taking raw data and organizing or transforming it to be more easily visualized, explained, or modeled; one of the six practices of EDA.

### T
- **Third-party data**: Data gathered outside your organization and aggregated.

### V
- **Validating**: The process of verifying that the data is consistent and high quality; one of the six practices of EDA.
