### Blogs on Medium
Jupyter notebooks and coding exhibitions aren’t the only means by which you can demonstrate expertise. Blog posts are another great way to propel your professional development. One of the advantages of blogs is that they showcase a wide range of highly sought-after skills beyond just technical proficiency. For example, not only will a well-written blog post convey your understanding of data concepts, tools, and techniques, but it will also emphasize your critical thinking, communication, and writing skills. These types of skills are what distinguish the best data professionals in the field.

Medium is a great platform to post data science-related blogs. You can also submit to publishers of curated data science content, such as Towards Data Science, Analytics Vidhya, and KDNuggets. As an example, consider the following

(the instructor of this course) that was published on Towards Data Science.

### GitHub repositories
Another way to feature your work is by using GitHub. GitHub is probably best known for being a version control system used by coders and developers worldwide to keep track of projects involving large codebases with many simultaneous contributors. GitHub also offers tools to create and customize user profiles and project repositories. Take
Ravin Kumar’s GitHub page
for example.

### Notebooks on Kaggle 
If you prefer to compose a more technical exposition of your work, Kaggle is a great place to do it. For example, consider
Jesse Mostipak’s profile
. Jesse is a data professional who uses Kaggle to contribute coding exemplars and datasets, participate in modeling competitions, and converse with others in the data community.

The following is an example of a notebook she submitted as a tutorial on using XGBoost in tidymodels, which is a collection of R packages for modeling and machine learning. You’ll learn how to use XGBoost with Python later in this certificate program.
