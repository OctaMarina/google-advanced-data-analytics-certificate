# Feature Types in Machine Learning

In machine learning, understanding feature types is essential for selecting appropriate models and preprocessing techniques. Here are the main types:

## 1. Categorical Feature
- Represents distinct categories or labels.
- Values are usually strings or class labels.
- No inherent order (e.g., "red", "blue", "green").
- Example: `['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']`

## 2. Numeric Feature
- Represents measurable quantities and has a numerical meaning.
- Can be either discrete or continuous.

### a) Discrete Feature
- Takes countable values, often integers.
- Gaps exist between possible values.
- Example: `[0, 1, 2, 3]` (number of children)

### b) Continuous Feature
- Can take any real number within a range.
- Infinite possible values.
- Example: `[1.5, 3.14, 7.0]` (height, weight)

Understanding the type of each feature helps determine how to encode, scale, or transform the data.
