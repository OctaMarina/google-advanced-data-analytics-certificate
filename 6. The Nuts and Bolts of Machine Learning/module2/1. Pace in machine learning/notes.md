## Summary: The Plan Stage of the PACE Workflow

The **Plan stage** is the foundational phase of the PACE workflow, where data professionals define the problem, decide if a machine learning model is needed, and determine the appropriate model type (supervised vs. unsupervised, regression vs. classification).

This stage includes:
- Identifying the goal and required outcomes.
- Choosing suitable algorithms based on the nature of the data.
- Verifying if sufficient and relevant data is available.
- Ensuring tools and resources are adequate for the task.

While the plan provides initial direction, it can evolve throughout the project. A thoughtful Plan stage increases the likelihood of project success.


## Introduction to feature engineering
The process of using practical, statistical, and data science knowledge to select, transform, or extract characteristics, properties, and attributes from raw data.

Three general categories of feature engineering are:
* Selection
* Transformation: Modifying existing features in a way that improves accuracy when training the model
* Extraction: Taking multiple features to create a new one that would improve the accuracy of the algorithm

## Solve issues that come with imbalanced datasets
### Class imbalance: 
When a dataset has a predictor variable that contains more instances of one outcome than another.

Solutions:
- Downsampling 
- Upsampling
