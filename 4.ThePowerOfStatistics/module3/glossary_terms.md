# Glossary Terms from Module 3

## Course 4, Module 3

### Central Limit Theorem
The idea that the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases.

### Cluster Random Sample
A probability sampling method that divides a population into clusters, randomly selects certain clusters, and includes all members from the chosen clusters in the sample.

### Convenience Sample
A non-probability sampling method that involves choosing members of a population that are easy to contact or reach.

### Descriptive Statistics
A type of statistics that summarizes the main features of a dataset.

### Inferential Statistics
A type of statistics that uses sample data to draw conclusions about a larger population.

### Non-Probability Sampling
A sampling method that is based on convenience or the personal preferences of the researcher, rather than random selection.

### Nonresponse Bias
Refers to when certain groups of people are less likely to provide responses.

### Point Estimate
A calculation that uses a single value to estimate a population parameter.

### Population
Every possible element that someone is interested in measuring.

### Population Proportion
The percentage of individuals or elements in a population that share a certain characteristic.

### Probability Sampling
A sampling method that uses random selection to generate a sample.

### Purposive Sample
A non-probability sampling method that involves researchers selecting participants based on the purpose of their study.

### Random Seed
A starting point for generating random numbers.

### Representative Sample
A sample that accurately reflects the characteristics of a population.

### Sample
A subset of a population.

### Sample Size
The number of individuals or items chosen for a study or experiment.

### Sampling
The process of selecting a subset of data from a population.

### Sampling Bias
Refers to when a sample is not representative of the population as a whole.

### Sampling Distribution
A probability distribution of a sample statistic.

### Sampling Frame
A list of all the items in a target population.

### Sampling Variability
Refers to how much an estimate varies between samples.

### Sampling With Replacement
Refers to when a population element can be selected more than one time.

### Sampling Without Replacement
Refers to when a population element can be selected only one time.

### Simple Random Sample
A probability sampling method in which every member of a population is selected randomly and has an equal chance of being chosen.

### Snowball Sample
A method of non-probability sampling that involves researchers recruiting initial participants to be in a study and then asking them to recruit other people to participate in the study.

### Standard Error
The standard deviation of a sample statistic.

### Standard Error of the Mean
The sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.

### Stratified Random Sample
A probability sampling method that divides a population into groups and randomly selects some members from each group to be in the sample.

### Systematic Random Sample
A probability sampling method that puts every member of a population into an ordered sequence, chooses a random starting point in the sequence, and selects members for the sample at regular intervals.

### Target Population
The complete set of elements that someone is interested in knowing more about.

### Undercoverage Bias
Refers to when some members of a population are inadequately represented in a sample.

### Voluntary Response Sample
A method of non-probability sampling that consists of members of a population who volunteer to participate in a study.

# Terms and Definitions from Previous Modules

## A
**A/B Testing** - A way to compare two versions of something to find out which version performs better.

**Addition Rule (for mutually exclusive events)** - The concept that if the events A and B are mutually exclusive, then the probability of A or B happening is the sum of the probabilities of A and B.

## B
**Bayes’ Rule** - (Refer to Bayes’ theorem)

**Bayes' Theorem** - A math formula for stating that for any two events A and B, the probability of A given B equals the probability of A multiplied by the probability of B given A divided by the probability of B.

**Bayesian Inference** - (Refer to Bayesian statistics)

**Bayesian Statistics** - A powerful method for analyzing and interpreting data in modern data analytics.

**Binomial Distribution** - A discrete distribution that models the probability of events with only two possible outcomes: success or failure.

## C
**Classical Probability** - A type of probability based on formal reasoning about events with equally likely outcomes.

**Complement of an Event** - In statistics, refers to an event not occurring.

**Complement Rule** - A concept stating that the probability that event A does not occur is one minus the probability of A.

**Conditional Probability** - Refers to the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.

**Confidence Interval** - A range of values that describes the uncertainty surrounding an estimate.

**Continuous Random Variable** - A variable that takes all the possible values in some range of numbers.
