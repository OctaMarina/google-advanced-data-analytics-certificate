# Module 2: Probabilities

---
## Types of probability:
- Objective: based on statistics, experiments, and mathematical measurements
- Subjective: based on personal feelings, experience, or judgment

### Objective probability:
- Classical: based on equally likely outcomes
`Classical probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes`

- Empirical: based on experimental or historical data
`Empirical probability = Number of times a specific event occurs / Total number of events`

---
## Random experiment:
A process whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty.
- The experiment can have more than one possible outcome
- You can represent each possible outcome in advance
- The outcome of the experiment depends on chance

---
## Basic rules of probability:
- Complement rule
- Addition rule
- Multiplication rule

### Types of events:
- <b>Mutually exclusive events</b>: two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time
- <b>Independent events</b>: two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other

<b>Probability notation</b>
- <b>P(A)</b>: probability of event A
- <b>P(B)</b>: probability of event B
- <b>P(A')</b>: probability of event A not occurring

### Complement of an event: The event not occuring
`P(A) + P(A') = 1`
-> Complement rule

### Addition rule(for mutually exclusive events):
`P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)`

### Multiplication rule(for independent events):
`P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)`
