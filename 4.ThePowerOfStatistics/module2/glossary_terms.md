## Glossary – Course 4, Module 2

### A

- **Addition rule (for mutually exclusive events):**  
  The concept that if the events A and B are mutually exclusive, then the probability of A or B happening is the sum of the probabilities of A and B.

- **A/B testing:**  
  A way to compare two versions of something to find out which version performs better.

### B

- **Bayes' theorem / Bayes’ rule:**  
  A math formula for stating that for any two events A and B, the probability of A given B equals the probability of A multiplied by the probability of B given A divided by the probability of B.

- **Bayesian inference / Bayesian statistics:**  
  A powerful method for analyzing and interpreting data in modern data analytics.

- **Binomial distribution:**  
  A discrete distribution that models the probability of events with only two possible outcomes: success or failure.

### C

- **Classical probability:**  
  A type of probability based on formal reasoning about events with equally likely outcomes.

- **Complement of an event:**  
  In statistics, refers to an event not occurring.

- **Complement rule:**  
  The probability that event A does not occur is one minus the probability of A.

- **Conditional probability:**  
  The probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.

- **Confidence interval:**  
  A range of values that describes the uncertainty surrounding an estimate.

- **Continuous random variable:**  
  A variable that takes all the possible values in some range of numbers.

### D

- **Dependent events:**  
  Two events are dependent if one event changes the probability of the other event.

- **Discrete random variable:**  
  A variable that has a countable number of possible values.

### E

- **Empirical probability:**  
  Probability based on experimental or historical data.

- **Empirical rule:**  
  The values on a normal curve are distributed in a regular pattern, based on their distance from the mean.

- **Econometrics:**  
  A branch of economics that uses statistics to analyze economic problems.

### F

- **False positive:**  
  A test result that indicates something is present when it really is not.

### I

- **Independent events:**  
  Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not change the probability of the other event.

- **Inferential statistics:**  
  Statistics that use sample data to draw conclusions about a larger population.

- **Interquartile range:**  
  The distance between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).

### L

- **Literacy rate:**  
  The percentage of the population in a given age group that can read and write.

### M

- **Mean:**  
  The average value in a dataset.

- **Measure of central tendency:**  
  A value that represents the center of a dataset.

- **Measure of dispersion:**  
  A value that represents the spread of a dataset, or the amount of variation in data points.

- **Measure of position:**  
  A method by which the position of a value in relation to other values in a dataset is determined.

- **Median:**  
  The middle value in a dataset.

- **Mode:**  
  The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.

- **Multiplication rule (for independent events):**  
  If events A and B are independent, the probability of both A and B happening is the probability of A multiplied by the probability of B.

- **Mutually exclusive:**  
  Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.

### N

- **Normal distribution:**  
  A continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical on both sides of the mean and bell-shaped.

### O

- **Objective probability:**  
  Probability based on statistics, experiments, and mathematical measurements.

### P

- **Poisson distribution:**  
  A probability distribution that models the probability that a certain number of events will occur during a specific time period.

- **Posterior probability:**  
  The updated probability of an event based on new data.

- **Prior probability:**  
  The probability of an event before new data is collected.

- **Probability:**  
  The branch of mathematics that deals with measuring and quantifying uncertainty.

- **Probability distribution:**  
  A function that describes the likelihood of the possible outcomes of a random event.

- **Parameter:**  
  A characteristic of a population.

- **Percentile:**  
  The value below which a percentage of data falls.

- **Population:**  
  Every possible element that a data professional is interested in measuring.

### Q

- **Quartile:**  
  A value that divides a dataset into four equal parts.

### R

- **Random experiment:**  
  A process whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty.

- **Random variable:**  
  A variable that represents the values for the possible outcomes of a random event.

- **Range:**  
  The difference between the largest and smallest value in a dataset.

- **Representative sample:**  
  A sample that accurately reflects the characteristics of a population.

### S

- **Sample:**  
  A subset of a population.

- **Sample space:**  
  The set of all possible values for a random variable.

- **Sampling:**  
  The process of selecting a subset of data from a population.

- **Standard deviation:**  
  A statistic that calculates the typical distance of a data point from the mean of a dataset.

- **Standardization:**  
  The process of putting different variables on the same scale.

- **Statistic:**  
  A characteristic of a sample.

- **Statistical significance:**  
  The claim that the results of a test or experiment are not explainable by chance alone.

- **Statistics:**  
  The study of the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data.

- **Summary statistics:**  
  A method that summarizes data using a single number.

### S

- **Subjective probability:**  
  Probability based on personal feelings, experience, or judgment.

### V

- **Variance:**  
  The average of the squared difference of each data point from the mean.

### Z

- **Z-score:**  
  A measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a data point is.
