## One sample test
Determines whether or not a population parameter like a mean or proportion is equal to a specific value

## Two sample test
Determines whether or not two population parameter like two means or two proportions are equal to each other

# One Sample Test

A **one-sample test** is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether the mean (or proportion) of a single sample significantly differs from a known or hypothesized population parameter.

Typically, the process involves:

- Defining a null hypothesis (\(H_0\)) which states that there is no difference between the sample statistic and the population parameter.
- Defining an alternative hypothesis (\(H_a\)) which states that a difference exists.
- Calculating a test statistic (often a t-value or z-value) to evaluate the difference.
- Determining the p-value or critical region to assess if this difference is statistically significant.

Common examples include the one-sample t-test for means and one-sample z-test for proportions.


## One-sample z-test assumptions:
1. The data is a random sample of a normally distributed population
2. The population standard deviation is known
