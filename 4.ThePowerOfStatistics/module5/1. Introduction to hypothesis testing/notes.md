# Introduction to hypothesis testing

## Hypothesis testing: A statistical procedure that uses sample data to evaluate an assumption about a population parameter

### Steps for performing a hypothesis test

1. State the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis
2. Choose a significance level
3. Find the p-value
4. Reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis


### Null hypothesis: A statement that is assumed to be true unless there is convincing evidence to the contrary
### Alternative hypothesis: A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis, and is accepted as true only if there is convincing evidence for it
### Significance level: The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true
Usually it is 5%

### P-VALUE: The probability of observing results as or more extreme than those observed when the null hypothesis is true
A lower p-values means there is stronger evidence for the alternative hypothesis

### Decide
Reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis

### Drawing a conclusion:
* if p-value < significance level: reject the null hypothesis
* else fail to reject
